# tdd.js

TDD exercise based on Kent Becks great [Test-Driven Development by Example](http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-By-Example/dp/0321146530).

The original is using Java and some of the concepts don't port nicely into the crazy world of 
JavaScript, so I had to adapt it a bit.

Slides are [here](http://www.slideshare.net/JoergHenning/tdd-55500305).

## Instructions

Requires Node.js >= 4.0 and mocha installed globally. Run the examples via `mocha .` or `npm test`.

Pro tip: mocha has a `--watch` flag.
